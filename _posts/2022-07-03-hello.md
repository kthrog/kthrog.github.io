Well, it's been some time since I last put a blog post up on the internet, and this one is really more of a placeholder than anything. But I was ready to remove the stock blog posts that came with this jekyll theme, and leave something actually written by me in its place, so here it is.

If you're curious about the evolution of this site, check out the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/kaitlinthrogmorton.com). There were the early days, when this was just [a random blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20141018161806/http://kaitlinthrogmorton.com/) I kept, when this was the [home of my freelance business](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326082131/http://kaitlinthrogmorton.com/), and when it was the [repository of my graduate work](https://web.archive.org/web/20200209082555/http://kaitlinthrogmorton.com/). 

It now holds a piece of each of those former incarnations, and has become the main place on the internet where I record my library career updates and accomplishments. Stay tuned for whether or not the blog will live again!
